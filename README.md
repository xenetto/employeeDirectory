# Employee Directory


An application to view the entire employee directory at once and have quick access to their information.

In this app an employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by Id, Username and Fullname

  * Filter the users by Username

The application's UI is broken up into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
